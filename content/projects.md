## **GRADUATE THESIS**

**[1] Dynamic Load Balanced and Energy Aware Routing in Large Scale Wireless Sensor Networks**

Status: Defended

Downloads:[[Documentation](Masters_Thesis_SHKAMATH.pdf)]

## **ACADEMIC PROJECTS**

**[5] An RFID Based Personal Home Automation System**

Status: Completed

Duration: March 2010 - May 2010

Deliverables: Custom operation of common electrical appliances found in homes depending on the RFID tags detected when a person enters the house. Program TI's TRF960EVM RFID module to detect RFID tags. Broadcast the tag-id to all micaz motes connected to electrical appliances using a mote as a base station connected to a laptop.

**[4] Data Aggregation in Wireless Sensor Networks**

Status: Completed

Duration: Nov 2009 - Dec 2009

Deliverables: Program Crossbow Technology's MICA2 motes at photo-sensors in a network. The motes would send sensor readings packet to an aggregator mote located centrally at regular intervals. The aggregator mote will compute the difference in the readings of the two photo sensing motes and send a signal/message to a controller mote if the difference is greater than a preset threshold value. The controller mote would then take an appropriate action (sound the buzzer).

**[3] Wireless Quiz System using Low Power Microcontrollers**

Status: Completed

Duration: Oct 2009 - Dec 2009

Deliverables: Modify the presently existing Wired quiz buzzer system to a wireless buzzer system.
The design includes 32 wireless buzzers which are to be networked and controlled by a central controller (CC). Each node (buzzer) will send an RF signal to the central controller along with its 5 bit ID. The CC will identify the node and will broadcast the ID indicating the team which pressed the buzzer first.

**[2] High Performance Matrix Multiplication**

Status : Completed

Duration : Jan 2009 - April 2009 (Spring '09 - ECGR6090 Multicore Computing Course)

Deliverables : 1. Design a serial matrix multiplication algorithm.
2. Introduce blocking. Measure the performance by varying the block size.
3. Design an algorithm which performs matrix multiplication after calculating transpose of one of the matrices. Measure the performance.
4. Combine blocking and transpose method to design and algorithm and record the performance.
5. Design respective parallel algorithms for all algorithms discussed above. Measure their performance by varying the number of threads.
6. Document the results after a comprehensive study.

**[1] Simons Game using Renesas QSK26A Board**

Status :  Completed

Duration : March 2009 - May 2009 (Spring '09 - ECGR5101 Embedded Systems Course)

Deliverables : A dueling Simon's game is a dual player gameplay. The software efficiently manages game logic, user interface, and communication between devices. Features include alternating turns for pattern replication, LED and sound feedback (using PWM and a speaker), scoring, customizable settings, and error handling. Technical requirements involve compatibility with specified hardware (Renesas SKP26), real-time responsiveness, efficient memory usage, and the UART protocol to send and store scores to the connected PC.
